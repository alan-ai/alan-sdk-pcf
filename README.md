Quickly create AI agents with the Alan AI Platform. Enable human-like conversations and perform actions in any app through voice commands.

## The Intelligent App Platform

Alan AI is transforming enterprise software with a new approach, **Application-Level AI**. Instead of relying on manual development or isolated AI tools, we embed an intelligent layer into your application that builds features on demand.

Powered by our proprietary **Three-Layer AI (3LAI)** architecture, our system generates both business logic and UI in real time—no developers needed. It works across your entire app stack: the user interface, business logic, and data management.

The **Intelligent App Platform** lets companies integrate AI-driven interfaces into their existing apps in days, not months.

It creates a safe and validated environment from your app’s APIs, GUIs, and documentation, enabling accurate, context-aware code generation. At runtime, the AI acts like a self-coding engine—instantly creating new features based on user needs.

With Alan AI, your software becomes truly adaptive—responding, evolving, and scaling automatically.

This repository contains the **Alan AI SDK for Android**, enabling you to embed Alan's intelligent layer into your Android applications.
